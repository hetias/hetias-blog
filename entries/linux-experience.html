                <h2>The Linux Experience</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-p">
                <p>i've been using linux for almost 3 years now, i can't really believe it. Mostly because it never felt like that much of a big change and nowdays going back to windows might feel weird 'cause i would see all those problems that made me move to linux.</p>

                <p>Now, to say that linux it's perfect or <b>objectivly better</b> than Windows or MacOs would be a plain up lie. It does has issues but i would argue these are more tolerable than whatever Windows and MacOs will do to you</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why to do it?</h2>

                    There's something that it's hard to deny about linux, and it's about being more <b>technical</b> than other majors OS's. Not to say that other OS's cannot be it, but it may look more developer friendly at first, especially knowing how hackable and customizble the OS can be. You <b>really</b> can change whatever you want on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a programmer that was my reason to move here as i thought it would be a more friendly experience in that sense. And i can't deny that at all, if you're a developer linux can be smoother <b>sometimes</b>. But this can make the transition harder for non technical people that may not care about the intricacies of the OS, every time i see a problem my mind goes "Oh! let's see how to fix this"-mentality as i like to learn how the Operative System works and does stuff. But that's just me, and surely after solving the problem once i may not be so happy if it happens again. For someone non technical this is a horrible experience and linux wouldn't fix itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another reason was speed as i had a very slow laptop at this time and linux usually it's presented as more lightweight than Windows in general. I can't say it's faster but surely it's not slower than windows, but as time passes it's not rare to see benchmark between Windows and Linux where linux tends to be at pair or slightly better.

                    It's wonderful and at the same time atrocious how diverse the linux ecosystem is. Desktop enviroments, custom kernel versions, compositors, tiling windows managers and so much more that one gives for granted in Windows but here we can go full bananas with.The problem usually lies when you open apps that may not respect the same desktop enviroment design or may they not work because these expect you to use another linux distro and so much more. This diversity it's what makes linux special but at the same time hard to adopt, because besides the visual stuff if the <b>actual</b> important stuff doesn't work then we are in problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An OS it's just a bunch of software that let you use other software without worrying about managing hardware. Linux it's just a <i>kernel</i> which it's just the heart of the OS, but there so much more software that makes the whole OS to work. A distro it's a different way to manage that extra software, from custom kernels, alternative software options, and visual changes. To choose a distro it's to choose a class in an RPG, at first it's not that important but later on you may struggle. <br>
                    All my homies hate Canonical, but Ubuntu works and <i>besides their default Desktop enviroment</i> it's more user friendly than others. I would rescommend Fedora tho (homies doubt about Red Hat too) as very stable and really the influence that Red Hat has over it it's not as bad as Ubuntu with Canonical.<br>
                    Then we have to God distros, Arch and Debian, the neckbeards and the beardnecks. If you're new, just use Fedora for homework and Arch to break stuff (It's just one of those days when you lose a backup!).
                </p>

                    If you want to get software on Windows you usually download an installer from the internet, run it and it's done (THIS IS UNSAFE AS FUCK EVEN THO WE HAVE IT NORMALIZED). On linux you usually use a package manager that stores software and manages dependencies related to these. <b>I don't really know if you can break windows the same way you can brake linux</b> with dependencies problem, i think not but besides, breaking your system it's a huge deal in linux even if it may be rare.
                    Let's say you have package A (let's say a package it's just like a rar version of the binarie) and a package B, A depends on B and so if you want to install A, B has to be installed first so A can work properly. So, what if something goes wrong and B it's not correctly installed even if A got installed? Well, A it's not going to work. Right now i have 1190 packages in my system most of which may just be libraries that let other user program work, if i try to update but one really important library for reason doesn't update correctly we're fucked. This happen not so along with an update on Manjaro where a library (i think it was libxml?) failed on update so it just partially updated my system, which led firefox and emacs unusable. You can do a partial update if you know what you're doing, but most of the time it's better to do a full update at the right time and then check if everything it's still working, and if not <a class="link" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Timeshift"> timeshift </a> can save lives. Always backup your system before updating!

                    The number 1 reason not to like windows it's: ✨Microsoft✨. I really don't whant to be that guy but as for now, Microsoft if the biggest promoter of linux and (maybe) macOs by making Windows worst and worst each day it passes. From copilot, telemetry, adds even if you pay for a Windows Key, bloat on fresh installs and the usual Microsoft shenanigans that they have been doing since the 90's (maybe explorer changed it's name for edge but they're not so different).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Leaving the rant away. Maybe 90% of software in the world is build for Windows, there is no way out of that and even if we can use <a class="link" href="https://www.winehq.org/"> Wine </a> for most applications, the reality it's that some software may not work at all.
                    Some software that you use in windows may not be usable in linux even with Wine, and even if it works it may not be so stable. There's a lot of software that tries to replace common windows software like the whole office suit, but after 3 years i still just use Word and Excel through their web browser version as it's more reliable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gaming it's another big factor on play here. <br> I've never been unable to play something in linux <b>but</b> that's because i pretty much play games through steam and never had to deal with too aggressive anti-cheats. Games like battlefield, fortnite, League of Legends and other multiplayer and competitive games use anticheats and specially at the kernel level. This makes it impossible to run through wine and as it will plantly not work. But if you don't play any of these games (as i don't) you're probably up to go. In any case <a class="link" href="https://www.protondb.com/">this website</a> collects info about games and their compatibility with steam proton, which is just valve's flawored wine, check the games you play the most on there and you will see if these are playable or not.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Conclusions</h2>

            <div class="blog-p">
                <p>
                    I'm not moving to windows in the near future, i don't see much reasons for it as must of the stuff i usually do work fine. Linux it's a completly capable OS for most people in my opinion but it may sometimes do things in a way that has to be learned, and some of it's problems can be avoided.<br><br>
                    I can be more patient with Linux, it's a <b>whole operative system</b> made by a bunch of nerds, there's a lot of people working in linux for <b>free</b>, because they like the project and want it to improve. I respect that and i respect the wait in case of something breaking as, again, sometimes it's not even their job. With Windows it's a completly different thing, gigazillon dollar ass company being <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages">incompetent</a> it's just mind bowling, bad updates, bugs everywhere, shady marketing tactics, no way to opt-out some software from the OS. The only reason Microsoft can get await with this it's because no way people it's moving on from Windows. We'll see for how much time this goes.<br><br>

                    MacOs it's not better. The Operative System it's just a software layer that abstracts you from dealing with raw hardware, but the hardware it's yours (if not, then what am i paying for?). This doesn't apply with Apple, for which when you buy an iphone or mac, you're effectivly paying for a subscription for their hardware, as you can't do <b>anything</b> that an engineer at Apple didn't like or consider useful. Touch the hardware and you will end up with a very expensive brick, and remember to buy a Mac with 16gb of ram as if you buy one with 8gb, well, fuck you, you can't change them.<br>
                    I may be a linux tryhard but i <b>really</b> would love to see Apple do things right and fuck Microsoft from their Macrohard, as i consider them very competent and innovative (in technical stuff) than whatever the next thing suckerberg it's gonna buy, or copy otherwhise.<br><br>
                    The meme of IT people eventually leaving all this BS and moving to the forest, it's not a meme to me, but i will eventually do IT. To return to monkey, no AWS, libC, databases or microchips, just the grass on my feets and the sun on my skin.
