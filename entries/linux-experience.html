                <h2>The Linux Experience</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-p">
                <p>i've been using linux for almost 3 years now, not even i can really believe it. Mostyle because it never felt like that much of a big change to me and nowdays moving to windows might feel strange cause i would see all those problems that i just don't like in windows and just remember why i moved to linux.</p>

                <p>Stating that linux it's perfect or <b>objectivly better</b> than Windows or MacOs would be a plain up lie. It does has issues but i would argue these are more tolerable than whatever Windows and MacOs will do to you</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why to do it?</h2>

                    There's something that it's hard to deny about linux, and it's about being more <b>technical</b> than other majors OS's. Not to say that other OS's cannot be it, but it may look more developer friendly at first, especially knowing how hackable and customizble the OS can be. You <b>really</b> can change whatever you want on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a programmer that was my reason to move here as i thought it would be a more friendly experience in that sense. And i can't deny that at all, if you'r a developer linux can be smoother <b>sometimes</b>. But this can make the transition harder for non technical people that may not care about the intricacities of the OS, every time i see a problem my mind goes "Oh! let's see how to fix this"-mentality as i like to learn how the Operative System works and does stuff. But that's just me, and surely after solving the problem once i may not be so happy if it happens again. For someone non technical this is a horrible experience and linux wouldn't fix itself.</p>

                <p>
                    Another reason was speed as i had a very slow laptop at this time and linux usually it's presented as more lightweight than Windows in general. I can't say it's faster but surely it's not slower than windows, but as time passes it's not rare to see benchmark between Windows and Linux where linux tends to be at pair or slightly better.

                    It's wonderfoul and at the same time atrocious how diverse the linux ecosystem is. Desktop enviroments, custom kernel versions, compositors, tiling windows managers and so much more that one gives for granted in Windows but here we can go full bananas with.The problem usually lies when you open apps that may not respect the same desktop enviroment design or may they not work because these expect you to use another linux distro and so much more. This diversity it's what makes linux special but at the same time hard to adopt, because besides the visual stuff if the <b>actual</b> important stuff doesn't work then we are in problems.
                </p>

                    If you want to get software on Windows you usually download an installer from the internet run it and it's done. On linux you usually use a package manager that stores software and manages dependencies related to these. <b>I don't really know if you can break windows the same way you can brake linux</b> with dependencies problem, i think not but besides, breaking your system it's a huge deal in linux even if it may be rare.
                    Let's say you have package A (let's say a package it's just like a rar version of the binarie) and a package B, A depends on B and so if you want to install A, B has to installed first so A can work properly. So, what if something goes wrong and B it's not correctly installed even if A got installed? Well, A it's not going to work. Right now i have 1190 packages in my system most of which may just be libraries that let other user program work, if i try to update but one really important library for reason doesn't update correctly we're fucked. This happen not so along with an update on Manjaro where a library (i think it was libxml?) failed on update so i just partially updated my system. You can do a partial update if you know what you're doing, but most of the time it's better to do a full update at the right time and then check if everything it's still working, and if not <a class="link" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Timeshift"> timeshift </a> can save lives. Always backup your system before updating!

                    The number 1 reason not to like windows it's: ✨Microsoft✨. I really don't whant to be that guy but as for now, Microsoft if the biggest promoter of linux and (maybe) macOs by making Windows worst and worst each day it passes. From copilot, telemetry, adds even if you pay for a Windows Key, bloat on fresh installs and the usual Microsoft shenanigans that they have been doing since the 90's (maybe explorer changed it's name for edge but they're not so different).
                </p>

                    Leaving the rant away. Maybe 90% of software in the world is build for Windows, there is no way out of that and even if we can use <a class="link" href="https://www.winehq.org/"> Wine </a> for most applications, the reality it's that some software may not work at all.
                    Some software that you use in windows may not be usable in linux even with Wine, and even if it works it may not be so stable. There's a lot of software that tries to replace common windows software like the whole office suit, but after 3 years i still just use Word and Excel thought their web browser version as it's more reliable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gaming it's another big factor on play here. <br> I've never been unable to play         something in linux <b>but</b> that's because i pretty much play games throught steam and never had to deal with too agresive anti-cheats. Games like battlefield, fortnite, League of Legends and other multiplayer and competitive games use anticheats and specially at the kernel level. This makes it imposible to run through wine and as such will plantly not work. But if you don't play any of these games (as i don't) you're probably up to go. In case of cuestion <a class="link" href="https://www.protondb.com/">this website</a> collects info about games and their compatibility with steam proton, which is just valve's flawored wine, check the games you play the most on there and you will see if these are playable or not.</p>

                    I'm not moving to windows in the near future, i don't see much reasons for it as must of the stuff i usually do work fine. Linux it's a completly capable OS for most people in my opinion but it may sometimes do things in a way that has to be learned, and some of it's problems can be avoided.
