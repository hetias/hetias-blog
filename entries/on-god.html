                    I never been a devoted or religious person. Nor has been my family or people close to me. When i was younger i had a vague idea of God, it's does and dont's, but honestly it felt like a 1984 type of big brother as "he sees and hears all you do" really didn't fit with me. Surely a relationship about fear. <br>
                    When i grew up i <b>obviously</b> became an atheist, any type of superstition or religious idea seemed a response of the week or ignorant people. Why to believe in God? I mean, if you need answers you already got science in your right hand, more answers? Philosophy on your left hand then. Now days i think about that as naive but surely something that most people go through.

                <p>
                    Even tho i'm not a believer i can hardly say i'm a complete atheist, as atheism eventually falls short. By definition all atheism does is to not consider the existence of God, it's not a active denial but a pasive non believe.
                    <br>
                    I remember in high school a history teacher dropping an argument in favor of believing: "Atehist deny God but on denying it, they give it validity as something that already exists" it's like denying the existence of girraffes, a dumb argument but it sure worked for a class of 16 year olds (do theachers really feel smart for this type of things?). Again that it's just a common misunderstanding of atheism, it's not about denial but about the not consideration of it's existence. The problem usually lies in the fact that atheist eventually try to prof the inexistence of the inexistent insted of just "i just don't believe it bro".
                    <br>
                    Don't take me wrong here, it's not bad to have discussion about God but in general i think it's <b>always</b> a waste of time because all believers have to do it's, to believe. It's interesting to wonder about believers trying to proff God's existence, what's the point on faith if you need proof and evidence for people to believe in God? You're a believer that has proff of God's existence, what if that proof didn't exist? would you still believe?
                    <br><br>
                    God it's unproofable and incomprehensible, so there is no way to know about it's existence unless it literally show itself. It's literally imposible for it to exist <b>that's the point of faith</b>, believing in the imposible.
                    <br>
                    This get's funkier when we specify <b>which God</b> are we talking about? The christian trinity? Allah? whatever the Jewish believe? Maybe some greek God...
                    <br>
                    Implicitly we talk about the Christian God, because it's the most popular of them all, or more generally about Yawhe by considering the three Abrahamic religions. But there's so much God's out there man, even worst than that, people from the same religion may have a different opinion on what God is, what it does, why it does. The definitions of God vary a lot and as such you may encounter people believe in God in ways you never expected, even tho i'm not a Christianity fanboy i really like the scope thorught which <a class="link" href="https://www.enlightened-spirituality.org/Meister_Eckhart.html">Meister Heckart</a> explored God: "If I had a God I could understand, I would no longer consider him God.‚Äù
                    <br>
                    But why to believe in Jesus if there are so many other God's to believe in? Yes, Jesus it's not the first, nor the last. We humanity have created God's since millenia, we have made stories and mythologies of these beings who reign over  us. You <b>really</b> don't think there is something more deep on that idea? Why humans do this? Where it lead us?
                    <br></br>
                    In my last year of higschool i had to make this class project with a group of friends, where we had to explore a topic from where we live. It was a investigation project and it seemed fun, we choosed to talk about myths as we knew a bunch of them from here and we thought it could be interesting to make interviews and stuff like that to people and figure out how much do they really believe on such myths. Sadly this was in 2020. So no interview, no school, no nothing. But we still had to make the project tho.<br>
                    I remember rushing it mostly alone and with my classmates just giving me PDF's about things that <b>*may help*</b>. I remember pretty much nothing from that project, expect one interesting cuestion that arised from one of the books. Some myths repeat throughout different cultures (and religions) even if such cultures never had a direct or indirect connection that could explain influences between one and the other. So, how it's possible for myths to be so similar between independent cultures with no influences? <br>
                    At that time i just finished the project but kept that cuestion floating. It wasn't till i got to uni that i got a close anser thanks to <a class="link" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jung">Jung</a>. Learning and reading about him has made a <b>huge</b> impact in my life even if sometimes it's hard to agree <i>with some things</i>, <b>his core ideas</b> make enough of sense. <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDYqIK_NYzw6I41Mk9P2qDW-I0cC5DLk4">here's</a> a playlist diving into <b>Aion</b>, one of Jung's books but with an overall introduction to Jung's ideas.<br>
                    What i want to point out here it's the psychological emphasis that Jung puts into religion, and how the world of the unconcious mind takes shape and form into religious symbolysm. It's not convenient to think of Jung just as a mere psychologist, as most of it's work eventually may fall into really hard things to grasp or <b>*proof*</b>, but rather take a more phiosophical approach into him. <br>
                    Explaining religion from a psychological approach gives it a lot more depth, and with that religion stoped being just a shallow thing to me. Religion it's unavoidable, it's in human nature to believe and something that i took from Jung it's that <b>everyone believes in something, the ones that don't just don't know it yet</b>, on it's book <a class="link" href="">The Undiscovered Self</a> there's this idea of how the States try to use religion (or get rid of it) as a way to redirect that religious energy towards itself (actually more complicated than that, read the book) and in some way God it's replaced for a new authority which now dictates it's own rules. I really encourage you on reading the book as i'm oversimplifying a lot, but you get the idea. So, what do you believe in?
                    <br><br>
                    All of this to say, there's more than science and reason in this world (for good or bad). I don't consider myself an atheist not because i believe, but because i don't know what i believe, or what should be believed. I don't consider myself an atheist because i'm looking for beliefs, to make sense of the things that don't make sense. Looking for answers that are <i>mostly</i> internal. Why am i here? What's my purpose? How do i achieve it? How can i liberate myself from the fog that stops me from succeding? This are, i guess, quite spiritual questions.<br>
                    I remember once thinking that "reading the bible it's like reading harry potter" as a way to invalidate the bible. Today i think the same thing, but in a different way. Take off all the magical and mystical stuff from both books, and focus on the <b>actual</b> stories being told as archetipycal experiences that most human beings may go through.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why not theism?</h2>

            <div class="blog-p">
                <p>
                    <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Camus</a> considered religion as intelectual suicide, fair enough but after the last section it's hard for me to make such a bold claim. I think that believing it's not a choise, you do it or else you don't, forcing yourself in believing on something that you may think it's not actually true <b>it's an actual intellectual suicide</b> specially if you don't admit the dogmatic believe to yourself.<br>
                    To believe in God it's a <b>very</b> personal experience, and people need something back to proof their own believes to themselves (i want to believe this...atleast). Religious experiences, suggestion, convenience, call it as you like but there is a reason why a lot of teenagers eventually stop believing even if they come from devoted families, maybe they never really <b>felt</b> what they thought should be God's presence.
                    I went to a Christian Highschool with all it's good stuff, and in the last year before graduation they do this spiritual trip's where a lot of non believers say to have started to believe after experiencing such thing. In my last year we didn't go because of <b>*covid*</b> but it's pretty much a trip to a natural place and making prayers, singing religous songs all with a big group of people (where everybody knew each other). That is a ritual. Have you ever seen videos of native's dancing and singing in group in the name of their own God's and stuff like that? Here it's the same thing. There's this idea of getting so involved into the group that eventually, for a period of time individuality losses off, one is with the group, singing, dancing, praying. This are religious experiences that could put once mind at the edge and eventually <b>to see far beyond the lands of reason</b>.<br>
                    This is the same reason why the evangelical's do all their fancy spectacle work, from outside seems dumb, but from the inside everyone (or atleast the ones that *believe*) is immersed on this experience. Like it or not, music can trigger this, there's nothing more stupid than a moshpit but people are so stuck into the present moment and the rushing feelings to do it. <br>
                    Religous experiences are more than just religion.
                    <br><br>
                    Where the dogmatic line should be placed? how does one define such thing? Some flatearthers are religious, and will give you scripture based reasons of <b>why</b> the earth it's flat. This is the type of things that make religious people so unlikable, crossing the line of just believing in the imposible (God) to just blatantly believe in the false, denying science and in a very ironic turn, trying to put science in the same dogmatic line as religion, trying to equate believe in religions as believing in science. Sadly they *kinda* have a point on this as there is a lot of scientific knowledge that we do give for granted. Thanks to flatearthers (well actually to the people debating against them) i learned <b>why</b> the earth is not flat and not just <b>the fact</b> of it not being flat (can you demostrate that?). There should be not point of conflict between religion and science, as these tackle different problems on different realms. But <i>yeah</i> reality hits hard on this one, specially with islam where there's no difference between law and religion and science would have to comply with it.<br>
                    This is the main reason why i don't like to call myself a believer (I like Justin tho). Sensing that pit of dogma and feeling that if i loose grip on reality i may fall on it, but i can't see it, so how do i know? I want to reiterate <b>believe it's not a choice</b>, or at least that's what i believe (Goddamn!) and so the dread of blindly deeping on the unknown it's undesirable.<br><br>
                    Yeah yeah yeah, it's not like one day i will read the bible and the next day i will start denying evolution or basic physics. Slypery slope whatever-thing. But i don't think it has to be that radical to become a bad idea. Imagine trusting the Pope. Or taking some scriptures <i>a lil bit too</i> literally. My uncle once tolde this story. There's this pigramage that occurrs between my city and another not so far away in july. He saw one pilgrim with a cow, asked him why did he had a cow? and he answered "The priest told us that it would be a good offering for God" and continued walking. Luther really would be mad. And with that, my uncle stop believing in the Church. Should i say the ch*rch. Just a priest being a asshole with a <i>poor</i> pilgrim, but to lie to me they sould be more intelligent than that! <i>it would be really bad if i started to blindly believe on something, uh?</i>
